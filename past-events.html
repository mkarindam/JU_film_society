                        <p>Our first screening event after forming the Jadavpur University Film Society was both thrilling and nerve-racking. It was the screening of Jojo Rabbit and World of Glory. We were uncertain about the turnout, but to our delight, the event was a huge success. The Vivekananda Hall was packed, and the audience's engagement exceeded our expectations. Jojo Rabbit brought a mix of humor and profound seriousness, leaving the audience with a lasting impression. The film's comedic elements had everyone laughing, but its deep and serious tone at the end really hit home. In contrast, World of Glory provided a beautiful cinematic experience, captivating everyone with its artistic presentation. Overall, the event was a milestone for our newly formed society, and the positive reception has motivated us to plan more screenings in the future.</p>

                        <h3>A Tale of Two Sisters</h3>
                        <p>On September 23, 2022, the Film Society of Jadavpur University hosted a screening of the renowned South Korean horror film, "A Tale of Two Sisters" (2003), directed by Kim Jee-woon. This event, held at the university's auditorium at the World View center, attracted a diverse audience comprising students, faculty, and cinephiles. The screening was followed by a discussion session led by Prof. Arijeet Mandal, a noted film scholar specializing in Horror cinema. 
                        The screening of "A Tale of Two Sisters" at Jadavpur University was a resounding success, offering attendees an opportunity to engage with a seminal work of Korean horror cinema. The event underscored the film's artistic and cultural significance, while the post-screening discussion facilitated a deeper understanding of its thematic richness and narrative complexity. As Korean cinema continues to gain international acclaim, events such as this serve as vital platforms for academic and cultural exchange, enriching the university's intellectual landscape and fostering a greater appreciation for global cinematic traditions.</p>

                        <p>Panel discussion on “Subtitles in Cinema: Of Tales That Lie Beyond”. The film “Adieu Godard” was screened and won at the Kolkata International Film Festival. There was an interview session with director Amartya Bhattacharyya following the screening. Adieu Godard is a socio-cultural comic tribute to the legendary French filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard. Shot in beautiful black-and-white by the film's director Amartya Bhattacharyya, Adieu Godard is a celebration of both cinema and personal enlightenment that pays charming tribute to the fêted French auteur.</p>

                        <h3>Godard Mon Amour</h3>
                        <p>Screening of “A Woman Is A Woman”  and “Weekend” followed by a session with Prof. Shubhajit Chatterjee and Dr. Anindya Sengupta respectively. The screenings were housefull both days along with the discussion. Both the films are a masterclass in style and experimentation. Weekend is a stark departure in tone and style. It's a satirical, almost apocalyptic critique of consumer society. The film's depiction of violence, decay, and societal breakdown serves as a powerful commentary on the state of the world in the late 1960s. It's less about narrative cohesion and more about provoking thought and discomfort. Characters in A Woman Is a Woman directly address the audience, and in Weekend, there are intertitles and monologues that break the narrative illusion. Both films contain self-referential elements. The discussion was followed by a lively Q&A session with the audience. Questions ranged from inquiries about specific scenes and techniques to broader questions about Godard's political views and their influence on his work.</p>
